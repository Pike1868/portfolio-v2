                        I’m an IT professional with over four years of experience in server administration, database management, and supporting enterprise-scale environments. I work daily with Windows Server, SQL Server, and Azure, keeping systems stable and helping teams stay productive.

                        My background includes troubleshooting SQL databases, IIS configurations, and connectivity issues across hybrid cloud infrastructures. I enjoy identifying root causes, improving performance, and helping others grow, whether that’s mentoring new team members or automating routine tasks with PowerShell.

                        I started in IT support before being promoted to Operations Analyst, where I helped design better internal processes and administered multiple software systems used across IT, marketing, sales, and customer support. I often worked with account managers to define project needs, configure systems, and ensure smooth implementations across departments.

                        Currently I’m working as a Software Support Engineer and Project Engineer, expanding my problem-solving skills by listening to customer pain points to gather requirements, recommend solutions that integrate with their existing systems, and work with them step by step to implement products, gather feedback, and fine-tune configurations to meet their expectations.
